### Something I noticed:
- I deployed the GitHub-Demo page we just did via **GitHub Pages**.
- After that, I edited  the text in index.html again and did another commit and git push to my remote.
- The Git Pages deployment updated but I could only see the old version of text.
- It turns out you need to ~~clear browser data~~ (Chrome) to be able to see the updated version.
